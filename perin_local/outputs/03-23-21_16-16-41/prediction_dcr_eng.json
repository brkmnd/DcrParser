In the first step, the customer will write an email asking if there are any bikes available at that time. Swapfiets online customer service will receive the email and contact the Swapfiets store employees, those are the ones who check the availability of the bikes. If no bikes are available, Swapfiets online customer service will notify the customer, and the service will not be supported. Otherwise, if bikes are available, the customer must fill in all the required information and pay the first fee while the Swapfiets store employees prepare the bike. Once they have completed everything, they can get the bike from the shop and the contract will be started. In case something is wrong, maintenance will be requested, and it will be the Swapfiets store employees who will fix or swap the bike. The customer will proceed to take the bike to the nearest Swapfiets store or also, the staff will pick up the bike at the customer's place, so that the store employees can check that it is something wrong. The bike will be analyzed, and depending on the damage, it will be swapped for another one, or fixed. Once the bike is ready to be used, the customer will pick it up at the store and start using it again. The maintenance process can be performed as many times as the bike requires. Once the customer wants to terminate the contract, provided that at least two months have passed since the beginning of the contract, he must send a warning message to Swapfiets employees saying that he wants to terminate the contract. The customer must take the bike to the shop, and the employees will check it and if everything is correct, they will register it as available and ready for a new rental contract.", "tops": [0], "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "swapfiets"}], "edges": []}

This then starts the production. The production has three phases, the preproduction, the production itself and the control of the product. The pre production mainly concerns following the required legislation in order to be allowed to produce the beverage as well as making sure all the machinery is fully functioning and that all the ingredients are available. This is mainly done by the HQ.The second step is the actual production of the Syrup/Liquid, Bottles,the bottling of the liquid and finally the packaging. The last step is the shipping process in which the warehouse will receive the shipment they need (this part also have ties to the beginning of the process as the warehouse sends an inquiry for more product). In the first phase the company must make sure that their standards follow the ISO 9001 and the ISO 22000, the company's own Quality and Food Safety policy and lastly the global standards of the Coca Cola company. This involves electronic bottle inspection equipment on all refillable bottling production lines to identify and reject even the tiniest irregularity in their beverages. Furthermore, the process must not violate any legislation when it comes to production of food or beverages In the 2nd phase the production process starts with the production team making sure all ingredients are available, then the machinery must maintained to reduce the risk of contamination or breakdowns. The ingredients must also inspected before production to make sure that there are no irregularities, if an irregularity presents itself, this batch of ingredients is declined and not used. The water used in the production goes through special treatments to ensure the microbiological safety. The water must have the correct concentration of naturally dissolved salts. The syrup is prepared in special tanks by first firstly dissolving the right amount of sugar in the treated water, and then afterwards filtering this water to remove any possible", "tops": [0], "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "preproduction"}], "edges": []}

Followed by this is the activity Check stock, which means that the purchaser must check whether or not the product is on stock, before he knows where to go next. There are now six paths the purchaser can execute which are based on the six different required scenarios and the two forbidden scenarios. The scenarios are described in detail later on in this section. The first thing the Purchaser does is checking if the item is on stock. From here he will move on directly to Check item value so that he knows if the product should be registered in the system for the individual user. This is a necessary step which needs to be done and is a result of checking the stock. Now if the item has a low value, it is ready for delivery, but if it has a high value the Check item value activity, makes Registration available for execution. After this has been done, the delivery of the item is now a mandatory part of the process. This will end with the purchaser always closing the order in ServiceNow. If the item is not on stock, the purchaser must first place the order from an external vendor. From here, the purchaser must again go to the activity of Check item value, so that he will know if the item should be registered or not. After this, the purchaser must ensure whether the item has been received, and if not, the purchaser contacts the vendor which is shown in the activities Check delivery status followed by Contact vendor.

To make the workflow reliable two different roles are assigned. The first one is a referee from the newly created quality assurance department while the second one represents the managing director of the hospital. Both roles execute all of their tasks independently from each other. The referee starts a new case regarding a certain doctor by interviewing patients. Since a patient interview workflow is already established, it is simply integrated in the new workflow. Meanwhile, the director asks an external expert to review the work of the doctor under rating. Unfortunately, since the expert only gets a low expenses fee, it can happen that the expert is not responding in time. If that happens, another expert has to be asked (who could also not respond in time, i.e. the procedure repeats). If an expert finally sends an expertise, it is received by the director and forwarded to the referee. The referee files the results containing the patient interviews as well as the expertise and afterward creates a report. While the referee is doing this, the manager fills a check to pay the expenses of the expert.", "tops": [0], "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "workflow"}], "edges": []}
