It is marked as an event because the negotiations are not considered an action in the scope, but the decision of choosing Tradeshift as the vendor of choice lies with the customer. Therefore, an XOR-gate with two outcomes: 1) Negotiations terminated, which leads to the event of terminating the process, 2) Tradeshift is Vendor of Choice, which leads to the action of handing the customer to Service Sales. Service Sales conducts the SoW workshop with the customer, in order to scope and align expectations for the project and notifies Professional Services of an incoming project. The next step in the process is for Service Sales to create estimations for the SoW, which is, for the scope of this report, three estimations occurring simultaneously. In the model, it is demonstrated with an AND-split which is used to model the split of the three actions happening in parallel. These parallel actions are then merged with the AND-join which is used '... to synchronize the execution of two or more parallel branches.' (Dumas et al., 2013; p.82). The SoW is sent to the customer for review, and the customer then decides, depicted by the XOR-gate, whether they want to reject the SoW which terminates the project, rework it by sending it back to Service Sales for reiterations, or sign the contract in order for the project to proceed. If the customer requests to rework the SoW, it is sent back to Service Sales, and the process loops back to before the AND-split gate. This means the grouped parallel actions of SoW Creation, and the SoW review is considered a repetition block. 'We have a workshop with a customer for 1-2 days then we prepare a draft for a SoW.

The SoW creation process is initiated by a workshop in which the Statement of Work is developed by the Service Sales department. The SoW creation workshop contains three events: 'estimate project length', 'estimate resource hours' and 'estimate project cost'. All the activities in the SoW creation workshop are nested as the Statement of Work can only be finished if all activities are executed, hence project length, hours and cost should be estimated in order for the SoW to be completed. The SoW is then evaluated before sending it to the customer. It can either be rejected or accepted internally by the Service Sales department. If the SoW is being rejected it is not required that all estimations have to be redone. The flexibility needs to be given in order for the Service Sales department to adjust only one or two estimations or even small formalities that do not require a new SoW creation workshop. Once the adjustment is done, the SoW can be sent for internal evaluation again. This process can be repeated as many times as needed until the SoW is accepted and finally sent to the customer. Once the SoW is sent to the customer, it cannot be modified and sent to the customer again. This ensures alignment between the two parties, Tradeshift and the Customer. The Customer is then responsible for reviewing the SoW and choosing one of the three following options: 'Rework SoW', 'Reject SoW' and 'Accept SoW'. Since these activities belong to a second subprocess ('Customer choice'), not all activities have to be executed before moving on to an activity outside of the subprocess. If the customer accepts the SoW, it is automatically handed over to the Professional Services department. Since the 'accept SoW' activity excludes itself, as well", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "therebethreeactor,orrole,involveinthestatementofwork(sow)creationprocessconsistoftwodepartment,theservicesaledepartmentandtheprofessionalservicedepartment,andthecustomer.thesowcreationprocessbeinitiatebyaworkshopinwhichthestatementofworkbedevelopbytheservicesaledepartment.thesowcreationworkshopcontainthreeevent:'estimateprojectlength','estimateresourcehour'and'estimateprojectcost'.alltheactivityinthesowcreationworkshopbenestedasthestatementofworkcanonlybefinishifallactivitybeexecute,henceprojectlength,hourandcostshouldbeestimateinorderforthesowtobecomplete.thesowbethenevaluatebeforesendittothecustomer.itcaneitherberejectoracceptinternallybytheservicesaledepartment.ifthesowbeberejectitbenotrequirethatallestimationhavetoberedo.theflexibilityneedtobegiveinorderfortheservicesaledepartmenttoadjustonlyoneortwoestimationorevensmallformalitythatdonotrequireanewsowcreationworkshop.oncetheadjustmentbedo,thesowcanbesendforinternalevaluationagain.thisprocesscanberepeatasmanytimeasneeduntilthesowbeacceptandfinallysendtothecustomer.oncethesowbesendtothecustomer,itcannotbemodifyandsendtothecustomeragain.thisensurealignmentbetweenthetwoparty,tradeshiftandthecustomer.thecustomerbethenresponsibleforreviewthesowandchooseoneofthethreefollowoption:'reworksow','rejectsow'and'acceptsow'.sincetheseactivitybelongtoasecondsubprocess('customerchoice'),notallactivityhavetobeexecutebeforemoveontoaactivityoutsideofthesubprocess.ifthecustomeracceptthesow,itbeautomaticallyhandovertotheprofessionalservicedepartment.sincethe'acceptsow'activityexcludeitself,aswell", "anchors": []}], "edges": [], "tops": [0], "framework": "dcr"}

Followed by this is the activity Check stock, which means that the purchaser must check whether or not the product is on stock, before he knows where to go next. There are now six paths the purchaser can execute which are based on the six different required scenarios and the two forbidden scenarios. The scenarios are described in detail later on in this section. The first thing the Purchaser does is checking if the item is on stock. From here he will move on directly to Check item value so that he knows if the product should be registered in the system for the individual user. This is a necessary step which needs to be done and is a result of checking the stock. Now if the item has a low value, it is ready for delivery, but if it has a high value the Check item value activity, makes Registration available for execution. After this has been done, the delivery of the item is now a mandatory part of the process. This will end with the purchaser always closing the order in ServiceNow. If the item is not on stock, the purchaser must first place the order from an external vendor. From here, the purchaser must again go to the activity of Check item value, so that he will know if the item should be registered or not. After this, the purchaser must ensure whether the item has been received, and if not, the purchaser contacts the vendor which is shown in the activities Check delivery status followed by Contact vendor.
