The webshop ordering includes 3 roles: webshop, customer and warehouse. The process starts when the customer enters Mikkeller.dk. Before the customer adds an item to his basket, he must decide the quantity of the product that he wishes to purchase. Once he has done so he adds the product to his basket. The webshop registers that a customer has sent the above request, and the webshop will then have to 'check stock availability'. Should the items be available, the webshop will proceed by adding the items to the basket. Unfortunately, it can happen that the chosen items are not available, if that happens the webshop will display the maximum amount available of the chosen product to the customer. The customer now has to choose the product again (and add an amount within the limit) or choose another product. If the customer has successfully added items to the basket, he or she have to decide to either keep shopping, thereby following the above process again or 'create order'. When the order has been created the customer will fill out the billing information. The webshop must then check that everything is fine if not, the customer will have to fill out the form again, otherwise the webshop will have to confirm the order by sending a confirmation order to the customer. If the customer regrets, the cancelation must be done within 30 minutes. If not cancelled within 30 minutes the webshop shall send a purchase order to the warehouse. After the warehouse has received the purchase order, they collect the requested products, pack them and send them to the customer. The customer then receives the ordered products.

In the first step, the customer will write an email asking if there are any bikes available at that time.

If no bikes are available, Swapfiets online customer service will notify the customer, and the service will not be supported. Otherwise, if bikes are available, the customer must fill in all the required information and pay the first fee while the Swapfiets store employees prepare the bike. Once they have completed everything, they can get the bike from the shop and the contract will be started. In case something is wrong, maintenance will be requested, and it will be the Swapfiets store employees who will fix or swap the bike. The customer will proceed to take the bike to the nearest Swapfiets store or also, the staff will pick up the bike at the customer's place, so that the store employees can check that it is something wrong. The bike will be analyzed, and depending on the damage, it will be swapped for another one, or fixed. Once the bike is ready to be used, the customer will pick it up at the store and start using it again. The maintenance process can be performed as many times as the bike requires. Once the customer wants to terminate the contract, provided that at least two months have passed since the beginning of the contract, he must send a warning message to Swapfiets employees saying that he wants to terminate the contract. The customer must take the bike to the shop, and the employees will check it and if everything is correct, they will register it as available and ready for a new rental contract.", "tops": [0], "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "theprocessstartwhenacustomerwanttorentabike,thisberequestonlinethroughtheywebsite.inthefirststep,thecustomerwillwriteaemailaskiftherebeanybikeavailableatthattime.swapfietsonlinecustomerservicewillreceivetheemailandcontacttheswapfietsstoreemployee,thosebetheonewhochecktheavailabilityofthebike.ifnobikebeavailable,swapfietsonlinecustomerservicewillnotifythecustomer,andtheservicewillnotbesupport.otherwise,ifbikebeavailable,thecustomermustfillinalltherequireinformationandpaythefirstfeewhiletheswapfietsstoreemployeepreparethebike.oncetheyhavecompleteeverything,theycangetthebikefromtheshopandthecontractwillbestart.incasesomethingbewrong,maintenancewillberequest,anditwillbetheswapfietsstoreemployeewhowillfixorswapthebike.thecustomerwillproceedtotakethebiketothenearestswapfietsstoreoralso,thestaffwillpickupthebikeatthecustomer'splace,sothatthestoreemployeecancheckthatitbesomethingwrong.thebikewillbeanalyze,anddependonthedamage,itwillbeswapforanotherone,orfix.oncethebikebereadytobeuse,thecustomerwillpickitupatthestoreandstartuseitagain.themaintenanceprocesscanbeperformasmanytimeasthebikerequire.oncethecustomerwanttoterminatethecontract,providethatatleasttwomonthhavepasssincethebeginningofthecontract,hemustsendawarningmessagetoswapfietsemployeesaythathewanttoterminatethecontract.thecustomermusttakethebiketotheshop,andtheemployeewillcheckitandifeverythingbecorrect,theywillregisteritasavailableandreadyforanewrentalcontract.", "anchors": []}], "edges": []}

The roles involved in the process are the Global Relationship Manager (GRM), a Customer Service Consultant (CSC), an accountant, the DataBase Administrator (DBA) and the Head of Development (HoD): The GRM receives a request to become retailer. Afterwards the GRM must request more information from the potential retailer. The retailer can only provide the requested information after the request has been made. Once the information has been provided, the information must be forwarded to the CSC by the GRM. Only after the information has been forwarded the CSC register the information in Oracle. The information can only be registered in Oracle once during the process. Afterwards the CSC must create a Jira task for the HoD. Then the HoD knows that he must create a contract. The creation of the contract should only happen once to prevent misunderstandings within the process. Only once the contract has been created the HoD can send the contract. After sending the contract two scenarios are possible: a) the contract is reviewed by retailer, b) the request is automatically cancelled after 30 days of no response from retailer. If the request is cancelled automatically the rest of the process will be cancelled as well. If the contract is reviewed by retailer two additional options are possible: retailer signs contract or retailer rejects contract. If the retailer rejects the contract, the request will either be cancelled or the HoD will refine the contract due to errors in the contract. Rejection of the contract will disable the rest of the process from happening. If the request is cancelled by the retailer the process will be cancelled. If the contract is refined it eliminates the option to cancel the request before the contract has been sent once again. If the retailer chooses to sign the contract during contract review, it shouldn't be possible to obtain more information, send the contract or cancel the request. After the retailer has signed the contract the GRM must receive the signed contract. After that the Finance department must create an invoice. The invoice can only be created once but can be sent multiple times after it has been created. After the invoice has been sent the retailer must pay the invoice once before the finance department will receive the payment one time. After the payment has been received the finance department must notify the GRM and the CSC. Once the GRM and CSC have been notified the following activities will happen: the GRM must upload the contract to COMA, the CSC must create a task in Jira for the HoD, register the retailer in webCRM once, and activate the retailer in Oracle once. These activities doesn't have to happen in any specific order, they must however all be executed before the welcome email can be sent by the GRM. The DBA must addition also register the retailer in the Retailer Portal and whitelist the IP address before the welcome email should be allowed to be sent. The tasks the DBA has to perform can only be done once per new retailer. Before the DBA can do these tasks the CSC must have created the task in Jira. The final activity of the process is when the GRM sends the welcome email.", "tops": [0], "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "theprocessspanfivedepartmentwithinthecompany:executive,customerservice,finance,itsysop(systemoperation)anditdevop(developmentoperation).theroleinvolveintheprocessbetheglobalrelationshipmanager(grm),acustomerserviceconsultant(csc),aaccountant,thedatabaseadministrator(dba)andtheheadofdevelopment(hod):thegrmreceivearequesttobecomeretailer.afterwardsthegrmmustrequestmoreinformationfromthepotentialretailer.theretailercanonlyprovidetherequestinformationaftertherequesthavebemake.oncetheinformationhavebeprovide,theinformationmustbeforwardtothecscbythegrm.onlyaftertheinformationhavebeforwardthecscregistertheinformationinoracle.theinformationcanonlyberegisterinoracleonceduringtheprocess.afterwardsthecscmustcreateajirataskforthehod.thenthehodknowthathemustcreateacontract.thecreationofthecontractshouldonlyhappenoncetopreventmisunderstandingwithintheprocess.onlyoncethecontracthavebecreatethehodcansendthecontract.aftersendthecontracttwoscenariobepossible:a)thecontractbereviewbyretailer,b)therequestbeautomaticallycancelafter30dayofnoresponsefromretailer.iftherequestbecancelautomaticallytherestoftheprocesswillbecancelaswell.ifthecontractbereviewbyretailertwoadditionaloptionbepossible:retailersigncontractorretailerrejectcontract.iftheretailerrejectthecontract,therequestwilleitherbecancelorthehodwillrefinethecontractduetoerrorinthecontract.rejectionofthecontractwilldisabletherestoftheprocessfromhappen.iftherequestbecancelbytheretailertheprocesswillbecancel.ifthecontractberefineiteliminatetheoptiontocanceltherequestbeforethecontracthavebesendonceagain.iftheretailerchoosetosignthecontractduringcontractreview,itshouldnotnotnotbepossibletoobtainmore", "anchors": []}], "edges": []}
