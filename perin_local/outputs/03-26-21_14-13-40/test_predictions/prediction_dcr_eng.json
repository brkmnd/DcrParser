The supply manager collects orders from shops.

The supply manager must then prepare a list of goods that are already available for the warehouse to deliver to the shops. The supply manager then dispatches this list over to the warehouse manager. The supply manager also contacts suppliers and provides quantity of goods that are needed for the warehouse.

This gives the student ambassadors the chance to sign up if they are available. After 3 days the poll is reviewed by the manage. If more than 3 have applied the manager assign three ambassadors for the visit. If less than 3 have replied the manager will notify the ambassadors again about the school visit and extend the sign up period by two days. After the extension of two days, the poll is reviewed again and if three or more student ambassadors have answered she will assign three ambassadors.

If the manager finds a room and available student ambassadors, the manager creates an agenda and sends the agenda as a confirmation to the school. Reasons for cancellation: If the date is not available the manager cancel the request.

This is mainly done by the HQ.The second step is the actual production of the Syrup/Liquid, Bottles,the bottling of the liquid and finally the packaging.

In the first phase the company must make sure that their standards follow the ISO 9001 and the ISO 22000, the company's own Quality and Food Safety policy and lastly the global standards of the Coca Cola company. This involves electronic bottle inspection equipment on all refillable bottling production lines to identify and reject even the tiniest irregularity in their beverages. Furthermore, the process must not violate any legislation when it comes to production of food or beverages In the 2nd phase the production process starts with the production team making sure all ingredients are available, then the machinery must maintained to reduce the risk of contamination or breakdowns. The ingredients must also inspected before production to make sure that there are no irregularities, if an irregularity presents itself, this batch of ingredients is declined and not used. The water used in the production goes through special treatments to ensure the microbiological safety. The water must have the correct concentration of naturally dissolved salts.
