Therefore, an XOR-gate with two outcomes: 1) Negotiations terminated, which leads to the event of terminating the process, 2) Tradeshift is Vendor of Choice, which leads to the action of handing the customer to Service Sales.;;Service Sales conducts the SoW workshop with the customer, in order to scope and align expectations for the project and notifies Professional Services of an incoming project.

In the model, it is demonstrated with an AND-split which is used to model the split of the three actions happening in parallel. These parallel actions are then merged with the AND-join which is used '... to synchronize the execution of two or more parallel branches.' (Dumas et al., 2013; p.82). The SoW is sent to the customer for review, and the customer then decides, depicted by the XOR-gate, whether they want to reject the SoW which terminates the project, rework it by sending it back to Service Sales for reiterations, or sign the contract in order for the project to proceed.;;If the customer requests to rework the SoW, it is sent back to Service Sales, and the process loops back to before the", "tops": [0], "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "negotiations"}], "edges": []}
