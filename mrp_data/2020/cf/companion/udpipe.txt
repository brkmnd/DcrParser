The referee starts a new case regarding a certain doctor by interviewing patients. Meanwhile, the director asks an external expert to review the work of the doctor under rating. Unfortunately, since the expert only gets a low expenses fee, it can happen that the expert is not responding in time. If that happens, another expert has to be asked (who could also not respond in time, i.e. the procedure repeats). If an expert finally sends an expertise, it is received by the director and forwarded to the referee. The referee files the results containing the patient interviews as well as the expertise and afterward creates a report. While the referee is doing this, the manager fills a check to pay the expenses of the expert.
When the insurance company receives a new claim , the clerk calls the agent to actually check the claim, and creates a new case. The activities are scheduled in parallel. After the agent has confirmed the claim to the clerk, he supports the customer with additional assistance (e.g. getting a new id-card from the public authority). After the clerk has received the confirmation from the agent, she issues a money order for the claim. If the agent has completed his additional support and the clerk has issued the money order, the claim is closed. The agent will confirm the claim only after having checked it.
A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished.
When an employee creates an expense report the money must be paid out within one week. After creating the expense report a manager should approve the expense report. if a manager approves the expense report the money can be paid out by finance. If the case is awaiting manager approval payout cannot happen. If the manager rejects the expense report he must later approve the expense report in order for payout to happen. The employee can redraw the expense report. Doing so will close the case. Once payout has been done the case is closed.
The customer makes an order on Wolt's website or mobile application. When Wolt receives the order, it is then registered. Wolt then has the order distributed to the restaurant where it can be either accepted or rejected. If the order is accepted, the restaurant begins preparing the food. Additionally, if delivery option is chosen and the order is accepted, Wolt's system immediately starts allocating a vacant courier that can pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. If they are in range and vacant they are prompted if they want to accept the order. If not, the allocating process restarts. If the courier accepts, they head towards the restaurant to pick up the order. When it is picked up, the courier travels towards the customer to deliver the order.

A school sends a request regarding school visit to the manager. The manager receives the request and checks the calendar. If date is available the manager assigns a date. The manager sends an email with school visit confirmed. The manager has to find student ambassadors and therefore sends out a poll to the student ambassadors informing them of the date. This gives the student ambassadors the chance to sign up. After 3 days the poll is reviewed by the manager. If more than 3 have applied the manager assigns three ambassadors for the visit. If less than 3 have replied the manager will extend the sign up period by two days. After the extension of two days, the poll is reviewed again and if three or more student ambassadors have answered she will assign three ambassadors. The manager contacts Facility management to check for available rooms. If there is an available room the room is booked. If some student ambassador is avaliable, the manager creates an agenda and sends the agenda as a confirmation to the school. If the date is not available the manager cancel the request. If there are no rooms available for the school visit, the manager must cancel the school visit.

Every time a translation order is received, an agent needs to check it. If the document is in a DOCX (Word) format, the agent analyses it in the ERP. If the document is a PDF format, the agent either converts the document manually to DOCX or calls the client and requests a different format document. Once the document is analysed, the agent sets a quota for the order in the system. The agent choose a translator from the database and sends a request to them. The translator can either accept or decline the task. If accepted the agent receives a notification and sends the quota to the client. If the client accepts it, a notification is sent to the translator that work can begin, otherwise if the quota is declined the order is closed. If the translator declines the request, the agent looks for another translator. Once the translator is done with the translation, the translator uploads the translated document. The agent will then check the translated work to ensure that it looks up-to-standard. If deemed satisfactory the agent will close the case and the translated document together with an invoice is sent to the client.
The Project Manager must hand over the Operational Readiness Review (ORR) documentation task to the Delivery Project Lead (DPL). The DPL must initialise the ORR process once. Then the DPL must create the documentation tasks for the different stakeholders. He sends these tasks to the Operations Team who creates the documentation required. The DPL also sends documentation tasks to the Project Manager, who then delegates the tasks in the project team. The Operations Team and the Project Manager sends the documentation to the DPL once the tasks are completed. The DPL receives it and compiles the documentation. Then the DPL sends an invitation to the Project Manager and the Operations Team Manager for an approval meeting If it gets rejected, the documentation has to be reworked. If there is rework, the approval will be in written format without a new meeting. After the approval, the DPL compiles the documentation and sends it to approval with the customer. The customer receives and reads the documentation, and either rejects or approves it. If rejected, the customer must send the documentation back to the DPL, who then facilitates the rework. If approved, the document is sent to the DPL.
The storage facility used by Puori sends a product sample to Ellipse. Ellipse then notifies Puori of the new sample. Before testing can begin, Puori then request a test of a sample through Ellipse. Ellipse must then test the product, as well as have additional testing done through Eurofarms. When all testing is done, results will be compiled into a report before sending the report to Puori for approval. If the results are different than expected, Puori may ask Ellipse for re-testing. If the results of the re-testing do not live up to Puoris standards, the batch will be discarded. If the results are sound Ellipse must send the results to Clean Label, who must then publish the results. Puori then checks whether all is in order and either approves of the publication, or compiles a list of possible errors. If errors are found, Clean Label must correct the errors before publishing the results again.
When the shop manager starts ordering, he has to select an item, and then checks the stock. He then enters the amount of product that is needed for the following days. Once everything has been ordered, the shop manager must confirm the order. After confirming the order, he may edit, cancel, or send the order to the shop supply manager. The supply manager collects orders from shops. If the supply manager does not receive an order list from a shop by the designated deadline, the supply manager will contact the shop manager. The supply manager must then prepare a list of goods. The supply manager then dispatches this list over to the warehouse manager. The supply manager also contacts suppliers and provides quantity of goods. The supply manager receives the ETA, finalizes the order, and then sends list of goods and ETA to the warehouse.
The production starts of with a warehouse sending an inquiry for more product. In the first phase the company must make sure that their standards follow the ISO 9001 and the ISO 22000, the company's own Quality and Food Safety policy and lastly the global standards of the Coca Cola company. This involves electronic bottle inspection equipment to identify and reject even the tiniest irregularity in their beverages. Furthermore, the process must not violate any legislation. In the 2nd phase the production process starts with the production team making sure all ingredients are available, then the machinery must be maintained. The ingredients must also inspected before production, if an irregularity presents itself, this batch of ingredients is declined and not used. The water used in the production goes through special treatments. The water must have the correct concentration of naturally dissolved salts. The syrup is prepared in special tanks by firstly dissolving the right amount of sugar in the treated water, and then afterwards filtering this water. Only after this the simple syrup is mixed with the Coca Cola concentrate to make up the liquid in its final form. After this a flash pasteurisation thermal process will then ensure that even the most sensitive products will not alter in their sensory characteristic. The filling and packaging process starts with the treated and cooled water being mixed with the final syrup and then the carbon dioxide is added. The drink is the filled into the bottles and ready to be packaged. The bottles must be perfectly clean, hermetically sealed, labeled, coded and tested. This is done by machines. The glass bottles are then placed in boxes while the plastic bottles and canned products go into various multipacks. The Product is then shipped to the warehouse.
The municipal council shall pay compensation for loss of earnings to persons maintaining a child under 18 in the home whose physical or mental function is substantially and permanently impaired, or who is suffering from serious, chronic or long-term illness. Compensation shall be subject to the condition that the child is cared for at home as a necessary consequence of the impaired function, and that it is most expedient for the mother or father to care for the child. Article (2) The requirement in paragraph (1) above that the child shall be cared for at home shall not apply to any child mentioned in paragraph (1) who has been placed in care under section 52(3)(vii) in connection with the child's hospital visit. It is a condition that the presence of the mother or father at the hospital is a necessary consequence of the child's functional impairment and that such presence is most expedient for the child.
Before the municipal council makes a decision under sections 51, 52, 52a, 56, 57a, 57b, 58, 62 and 63, section 65(2) and (3) and sections 68-71 and 75, the child or young person must be consulted on these matters. The consultation may be dispensed with if the child or young person was consulted immediately beforehand in connection with the performance of a child protection examination. The examination must be completed within four (4) months after the municipal council has become aware that a child or young person may be in need of special support. If the custodial parent fails to have a child or young person examined or treated for a life threatening disease or a disease involving the risk of substantial and permanent impairment of function, the children and young persons committee may decide to undertake such examination or treatment.

Mikkeller has created a webshop to sell their products to customers that are not able to buy them in physical stores or prefers to buy them online. The webshop ordering includes 3 roles: webshop, customer and warehouse. The process starts when the customer enters Mikkeller.dk. Before the customer adds an item to his basket, he must decide the quantity of the product that he wishes to purchase. Once he has done so he adds the product to his basket. The webshop registers that a customer has sent the above request, and the webshop will then have to 'check stock availability'. Should the items be available, the webshop will proceed by adding the items to the basket. Unfortunately, it can happen that the chosen items are not available, if that happens the webshop will display the maximum amount available of the chosen product to the customer. The customer now has to choose the product again (and add an amount within the limit) or choose another product. If the customer has successfully added items to the basket, he or she have to decide to either keep shopping, thereby following the above process again or 'create order'. When the order has been created the customer will fill out the billing information. The webshop must then check that everything is fine if not, the customer will have to fill out the form again, otherwise the webshop will have to confirm the order by sending a confirmation order to the customer. If the customer regrets, the cancelation must be done within 30 minutes. If not cancelled within 30 minutes the webshop shall send a purchase order to the warehouse. After the warehouse has received the purchase order, they collect the requested products, pack them and send them to the customer. The customer then receives the ordered products. The customer can always leave the webshop.
A description of the renting process at Kraemmergarden Dragor's shop. Our graph demonstrates the renting process and how a seller is able to extend and the decision process from management.
The process starts when a customer wants to rent a bike, this is requested online through their website. In the first step, the customer will write an email asking if there are any bikes available at that time. Swapfiets online customer service will receive the email and contact the Swapfiets store employees, those are the ones who check the availability of the bikes. If no bikes are available, Swapfiets online customer service will notify the customer, and the service will not be supported. Otherwise, if bikes are available, the customer must fill in all the required information and pay the first fee while the Swapfiets store employees prepare the bike. Once they have completed everything, they can get the bike from the shop and the contract will be started. In case something is wrong, maintenance will be requested, and it will be the Swapfiets store employees who will fix or swap the bike. The customer will proceed to take the bike to the nearest Swapfiets store or also, the staff will pick up the bike at the customer's place, so that the store employees can check that it is something wrong. The bike will be analyzed, and depending on the damage, it will be swapped for another one, or fixed. Once the bike is ready to be used, the customer will pick it up at the store and start using it again. The maintenance process can be performed as many times as the bike requires. Once the customer wants to terminate the contract, provided that at least two months have passed since the beginning of the contract, he must send a warning message to Swapfiets employees saying that he wants to terminate the contract. The customer must take the bike to the shop, and the employees will check it and if everything is correct, they will register it as available and ready for a new rental contract.
The process spans five departments within the company: Executives, Customer Service, Finance, IT SYSOPS (system operations) and IT DEVOPS (development operations). The roles involved in the process are the Global Relationship Manager (GRM), a Customer Service Consultant (CSC), an accountant, the DataBase Administrator (DBA) and the Head of Development (HoD): The GRM receives a request to become retailer. Afterwards the GRM must request more information from the potential retailer. The retailer can only provide the requested information after the request has been made. Once the information has been provided, the information must be forwarded to the CSC by the GRM. Only after the information has been forwarded the CSC register the information in Oracle. The information can only be registered in Oracle once during the process. Afterwards the CSC must create a Jira task for the HoD. Then the HoD knows that he must create a contract. The creation of the contract should only happen once to prevent misunderstandings within the process. Only once the contract has been created the HoD can send the contract. After sending the contract two scenarios are possible: a) the contract is reviewed by retailer, b) the request is automatically cancelled after 30 days of no response from retailer. If the request is cancelled automatically the rest of the process will be cancelled as well. If the contract is reviewed by retailer two additional options are possible: retailer signs contract or retailer rejects contract. If the retailer rejects the contract, the request will either be cancelled or the HoD will refine the contract due to errors in the contract. Rejection of the contract will disable the rest of the process from happening. If the request is cancelled by the retailer the process will be cancelled. If the contract is refined it eliminates the option to cancel the request before the contract has been sent once again. If the retailer chooses to sign the contract during contract review, it shouldn't be possible to obtain more
The end-to-end process chosen as the scope for this report is initiated by the event-start notation in the Sales department 'Negotiations with customer initiated'. It is marked as an event because the negotiations are not considered an action in the scope, but the decision of choosing Tradeshift as the vendor of choice lies with the customer. Therefore, an XOR-gate with two outcomes: 1) Negotiations terminated, which leads to the event of terminating the process, 2) Tradeshift is Vendor of Choice, which leads to the action of handing the customer to Service Sales. Service Sales conducts the SoW workshop with the customer, in order to scope and align expectations for the project and notifies Professional Services of an incoming project. The next step in the process is for Service Sales to create estimations for the SoW, which is, for the scope of this report, three estimations occurring simultaneously. In the model, it is demonstrated with an AND-split which is used to model the split of the three actions happening in parallel. These parallel actions are then merged with the AND-join which is used '... to synchronize the execution of two or more parallel branches.' (Dumas et al., 2013; p.82). The SoW is sent to the customer for review, and the customer then decides, depicted by the XOR-gate, whether they want to reject the SoW which terminates the project, rework it by sending it back to Service Sales for reiterations, or sign the contract in order for the project to proceed. If the customer requests to rework the SoW, it is sent back to Service Sales, and the process loops back to before the AND-split gate. This means the grouped parallel actions of SoW Creation, and the SoW review is considered a repetition block. 'We have a workshop with a customer for 1-2 days then we prepare a draft for a SoW. Then there is an internal SoW approval process. This is shared with
There are three actors, or roles, involved in the Statement of Work (SoW) creation process consisting of two departments, the Service Sales department and the Professional Services department, and the Customer. The SoW creation process is initiated by a workshop in which the Statement of Work is developed by the Service Sales department. The SoW creation workshop contains three events: 'estimate project length', 'estimate resource hours' and 'estimate project cost'. All the activities in the SoW creation workshop are nested as the Statement of Work can only be finished if all activities are executed, hence project length, hours and cost should be estimated in order for the SoW to be completed. The SoW is then evaluated before sending it to the customer. It can either be rejected or accepted internally by the Service Sales department. If the SoW is being rejected it is not required that all estimations have to be redone. The flexibility needs to be given in order for the Service Sales department to adjust only one or two estimations or even small formalities that do not require a new SoW creation workshop. Once the adjustment is done, the SoW can be sent for internal evaluation again. This process can be repeated as many times as needed until the SoW is accepted and finally sent to the customer. Once the SoW is sent to the customer, it cannot be modified and sent to the customer again. This ensures alignment between the two parties, Tradeshift and the Customer. The Customer is then responsible for reviewing the SoW and choosing one of the three following options: 'Rework SoW', 'Reject SoW' and 'Accept SoW'. Since these activities belong to a second subprocess ('Customer choice'), not all activities have to be executed before moving on to an activity outside of the subprocess. If the customer accepts the SoW, it is automatically handed over to the Professional Services department. Since the 'accept SoW' activity excludes itself, as well

If errors are found, Clean Label must correct the errors before publishing the results again. 
The process is always initiated when the purchaser receives an order request in their portal ServiceNow, which is modelled in the graph as an activity called Receive order in ServiceNow. Followed by this is the activity Check stock, which means that the purchaser must check whether or not the product is on stock, before he knows where to go next. There are now six paths the purchaser can execute which are based on the six different required scenarios and the two forbidden scenarios. The scenarios are described in detail later on in this section. The first thing the Purchaser does is checking if the item is on stock. From here he will move on directly to Check item value so that he knows if the product should be registered in the system for the individual user. This is a necessary step which needs to be done and is a result of checking the stock. Now if the item has a low value, it is ready for delivery, but if it has a high value the Check item value activity, makes Registration available for execution. After this has been done, the delivery of the item is now a mandatory part of the process. This will end with the purchaser always closing the order in ServiceNow. If the item is not on stock, the purchaser must first place the order from an external vendor. From here, the purchaser must again go to the activity of Check item value, so that he will know if the item should be registered or not. After this, the purchaser must ensure whether the item has been received, and if not, the purchaser contacts the vendor which is shown in the activities Check delivery status followed by Contact vendor. Lastly the order can be closed in ServiceNow, which is shown with the activity Close order in ServiceNow.
A school sends a request regarding school visit to the manager. The manager receives the request and checks the calendar. If date is available the manager assigns a date. The manager sends an email with school visit confirmed. The manager has to find student ambassadors and therefore sends out a poll to the student ambassadors informing them of the date. This gives the student ambassadors the chance to sign up if they are available. After 3 days the poll is reviewed by the manage. If more than 3 have applied the manager assign three ambassadors for the visit. If less than 3 have replied the manager will notify the ambassadors again about the school visit and extend the sign up period by two days. After the extension of two days, the poll is reviewed again and if three or more student ambassadors have answered she will assign three ambassadors. While the sign up period is running, the manager has to find a room. The manager contacts Facility management to check for available rooms. If there is an available room the room is booked. If the manager finds a room and available student ambassadors, the manager creates an agenda and sends the agenda as a confirmation to the school. Reasons for cancellation: If the date is not available the manager cancel the request. If less than three student ambassadors are available after the two sign up periods, the school visit must be cancelled. If there are no rooms available for the school visit, the manager is notified by the facility management and the school visit must be cancelled.
