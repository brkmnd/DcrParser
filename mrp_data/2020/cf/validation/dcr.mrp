The SoW creation process is initiated by a workshop in which the Statement of Work is developed by the Service Sales department. The SoW creation workshop contains three events: 'estimate project length', 'estimate resource hours' and 'estimate project cost'. All the activities in the SoW creation workshop are nested as the Statement of Work can only be finished if all activities are executed, hence project length, hours and cost should be estimated in order for the SoW to be completed. The SoW is then evaluated before sending it to the customer. It can either be rejected or accepted internally by the Service Sales department. If the SoW is being rejected it is not required that all estimations have to be redone. The flexibility needs to be given in order for the Service Sales department to adjust only one or two estimations or even small formalities that do not require a new SoW creation workshop. Once the adjustment is done, the SoW can be sent for internal evaluation again. This process can be repeated as many times as needed until the SoW is accepted and finally sent to the customer. Once the SoW is sent to the customer, it cannot be modified and sent to the customer again. This ensures alignment between the two parties, Tradeshift and the Customer. The Customer is then responsible for reviewing the SoW and choosing one of the three following options: 'Rework SoW', 'Reject SoW' and 'Accept SoW'. Since these activities belong to a second subprocess ('Customer choice'), not all activities have to be executed before moving on to an activity outside of the subprocess. If the customer accepts the SoW, it is automatically handed over to the Professional Services department. Since the 'accept SoW' activity excludes itself, as well","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Customer choice"},{"id":1,"label":"reject SoW"},{"id":2,"label":"accept SoW "},{"id":3,"label":"rework SoW"},{"id":4,"label":"send SoW to customer"},{"id":5,"label":"decline project"},{"id":6,"label":"handover from Service Sales"},{"id":7,"label":"SoW creation workshop"},{"id":8,"label":"estimate project length"},{"id":9,"label":"estimate resource hours"},{"id":10,"label":"estimate project cost"},{"id":11,"label":"close deal"},{"id":12,"label":"SoW evaluation"},{"id":13,"label":"internal SoW acceptance"},{"id":14,"label":"internal SoW rejection"},{"id":15,"label":"Customer"},{"id":16,"label":"Professional Services department"},{"id":17,"label":"Service Sales department"}],"edges":[{"source":1,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":2,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":3,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":5,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":6,"target":16,"label":"role"},{"source":7,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":9,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":10,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":11,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":13,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":14,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":0,"label":"condition"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"condition"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"condition"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"condition"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"condition"},{"source":4,"target":0,"label":"response"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"response"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"response"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"response"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":5,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":2,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":2,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":13,"target":7,"label":"exclude"},{"source":4,"target":4,"label":"exclude"},{"source":12,"target":12,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":11,"target":5,"label":"exclude"},{"source":3,"target":7,"label":"include"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"include"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"include"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"include"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"include"}]}

There are now six paths the purchaser can execute which are based on the six different required scenarios and the two forbidden scenarios.

This is a necessary step which needs to be done and is a result of checking the stock. Now if the item has a low value, it is ready for delivery, but if it has a high value the Check item value activity, makes Registration available for execution. After this has been done, the delivery of the item is now a mandatory part of the process. This will end with the purchaser always closing the order in ServiceNow. If the item is not on stock, the purchaser must first place the order from an external vendor. From here, the purchaser must again go to the activity of Check item value, so that he will know if the item should be registered or not. After this, the purchaser must ensure whether the item has been received, and if not, the purchaser contacts the vendor which is shown in the activities Check delivery status followed by Contact vendor.
