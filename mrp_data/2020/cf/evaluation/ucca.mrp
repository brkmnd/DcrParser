The manager receives the request and checks the calendar. If date is available the manager assigns a date. The manager sends an email with school visit confirmed. The manager has to find student ambassadors and therefore sends out a poll to the student ambassadors informing them of the date. This gives the student ambassadors the chance to sign up if they are available. After 3 days the poll is reviewed by the manage. If more than 3 have applied the manager assign three ambassadors for the visit. If less than 3 have replied the manager will notify the ambassadors again about the school visit and extend the sign up period by two days. After the extension of two days, the poll is reviewed again and if three or more student ambassadors have answered she will assign three ambassadors. While the sign up period is running, the manager has to find a room. The manager contacts Facility management to check for available rooms. If there is an available room the room is booked. If the manager finds a room and available student ambassadors, the manager creates an agenda and sends the agenda as a confirmation to the school. Reasons for cancellation: If the date is not available the manager cancel the request. If less than three student ambassadors are available after the two sign up periods, the school visit must be cancelled. If there are no rooms available for the school visit, the manager is notified by the facility management and the school visit must be cancelled."}

After creating the expense report a manager should approve the expense report. if a manager approves the expense report the money can be paid out by finance. If the case is awaiting manager approval payout cannot happen. If the manager rejects the expense report he must later approve the expense report in order to payout to happen. The employee can redraw the expense report. Doing so will close the case. Once payout has been done the case is closed."}

The roles involved in the process are the Global Relationship Manager (GRM), a Customer Service Consultant (CSC), an accountant, the DataBase Administrator (DBA) and the Head of Development (HoD): The GRM receives a request to become retailer. Afterwards the GRM must request more information from the potential retailer. The retailer can only provide the requested information after the request has been made. Once the information has been provided, the information must be forwarded to the CSC by the GRM. Only after the information has been forwarded the CSC register the information in Oracle. The information can only be registered in Oracle once during the process. Afterwards the CSC must create a Jira task for the HoD. Then the HoD knows that he must create a contract. The creation of the contract should only happen once to prevent misunderstandings within the process. Only once the contract has been created the HoD can send the contract. After sending the contract two scenarios are possible: a) the contract is reviewed by retailer, b) the request is automatically cancelled after 30 days of no response from retailer. If the request is cancelled automatically the rest of the process will be cancelled as well. If the contract is reviewed by retailer two additional options are possible: retailer signs contract or retailer rejects contract. If the retailer rejects the contract, the request will either be cancelled or the HoD will refine the contract due to errors in the contract. Rejection of the contract will disable the rest of the process from happening. If the request is cancelled by the retailer the process will be cancelled. If the contract is refined it eliminates the option to cancel the request before the contract has been sent once again. If the retailer chooses to sign the contract during contract review, it shouldnt be possible to obtain more information, send the contract or cancel the request. After the retailer has signed the contract the GRM must receive the signed contract. After that the Finance department must create an invoice. The invoice can only be created once but can be sent multiple times after it has been created. After the invoice has been sent the retailer must pay the invoice once before the finance department will receive the payment one time. After the payment has been received the finance department must notify the GRM and the CSC. Once the GRM and CSC have been notified the following activities will happen: the GRM must upload the contract to COMA, the CSC must create a task in Jira for the HoD, register the retailer in webCRM once, and activate the retailer in Oracle once. These activities doesnt have to happen in any specific order, they must however all be executed before the welcome email can be sent by the GRM. The DBA must addition also register the retailer in the Retailer Portal and whitelist the IP address before the welcome email should be allowed to be sent. The tasks the DBA has to perform can only be done once per new retailer. Before the DBA can do these tasks the CSC must have created the task in Jira. The final activity of the process is when the GRM sends the welcome email."}

In the first step, the customer will write an email asking if there are any bikes available at that time. Swapfiets online customer service will receive the email and contact the Swapfiets store employees, those are the ones who check the availability of the bikes. If no bikes are available, Swapfiets online customer service will notify the customer, and the service will not be supported. Otherwise, if bikes are available, the customer must fill in all the required information and pay the first fee while the Swapfiets store employees prepare the bike. Once they have completed everything, they can get the bike from the shop and the contract will be started. In case something is wrong, maintenance will be requested, and it will be the Swapfiets store employees who will fix or swap the bike. The customer will proceed to take the bike to the nearest Swapfiets store or also, the staff will pick up the bike at the customer's place, so that the store employees can check that it is something wrong. The bike will be analyzed, and depending on the damage, it will be swapped for another one, or fixed. Once the bike is ready to be used, the customer will pick it up at the store and start using it again. The maintenance process can be performed as many times as the bike requires. Once the customer wants to terminate the contract, provided that at least two months have passed since the beginning of the contract, he must send a warning message to Swapfiets employees saying that he wants to terminate the contract. The customer must take the bike to the shop, and the employees will check it and if everything is correct, they will register it as available and ready for a new rental contract."}

Ellipse then notifies Puori of the new sample. Before testing can begin, Puori then request a test of a sample through Ellipse. Ellipse must then test the product, as well as have additional testing done through Eurofarms. When all testing is done, results will be compiled into a report before sending the report to Puori for approval. This enables Puori to evaluate the results. If the results are different than expected, Puori may ask Ellipse for re-testing. If the results of the re-testing do not live up to Puoris standards, the batch will be discarded. If the results are sound Ellipse must send the results to Clean Label, who must then publish the results. Puori then checks whether all is in order and either approves of the publication, or compiles a list of possible errors. If errors are found, Clean Label must correct the errors before publishing the results again."}
