Then the DPL sends an invitation to the Project Manager and the Operations Team Manager for an approval meeting If it gets rejected, the documentation has to be reworked. If there is rework, the approval will be in written format without a new meeting. After the approval, the DPL compiles the documentation and sends it to approval with the customer. The customer receives and reads the documentation, and either rejects or approves it. If rejected, the customer must send the documentation back to the DPL, who then facilitates the rework. If approved, the document is sent to the DPL.","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Initialise the ORR

In the first phase the company must make sure that their standards follow the ISO 9001 and the ISO 22000, the company's own Quality and Food Safety policy and lastly the global standards of the Coca Cola company. This involves electronic bottle inspection equipment to identify and reject even the tiniest irregularity in their beverages. Furthermore, the process must not violate any legislation. In the 2nd phase the production process starts with the production team making sure all ingredients are available, then the machinery must be maintained. The ingredients must also inspected before production, if an irregularity presents itself, this batch of ingredients is declined and not used. The water used in the production goes through special treatments. The water must have the correct concentration of naturally dissolved salts. The syrup is prepared in special tanks by firstly dissolving the right amount of sugar in the treated water, and then afterwards filtering this water. Only after this the simple syrup is mixed with the Coca Cola concentrate to make up the liquid in its final form. After this a flash pasteurisation thermal process will then ensure that even the most sensitive products will not alter in their sensory characteristic. The filling and packaging process starts with the treated and cooled water being mixed with the final syrup and then the carbon dioxide is added. The drink is the filled into the bottles and ready to be packaged. The bottles must be perfectly clean, hermetically sealed, labeled, coded and tested. This is done by machines.
