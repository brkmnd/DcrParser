This then starts the production. The production has three phases, the preproduction, the production itself and the control of the product. The pre production mainly concerns following the required legislation in order to be allowed to produce the beverage as well as making sure all the machinery is fully functioning and that all the ingredients are available. This is mainly done by the HQ.The second step is the actual production of the Syrup/Liquid, Bottles,the bottling of the liquid and finally the packaging. The last step is the shipping process in which the warehouse will receive the shipment they need (this part also have ties to the beginning of the process as the warehouse sends an inquiry for more product). In the first phase the company must make sure that their standards follow the ISO 9001 and the ISO 22000, the company's own Quality and Food Safety policy and lastly the global standards of the Coca Cola company. This involves electronic bottle inspection equipment on all refillable bottling production lines to identify and reject even the tiniest irregularity in their beverages. Furthermore, the process must not violate any legislation when it comes to production of food or beverages In the 2nd phase the production process starts with the production team making sure all ingredients are available, then the machinery must maintained to reduce the risk of contamination or breakdowns. The ingredients must also inspected before production to make sure that there are no irregularities, if an irregularity presents itself, this batch of ingredients is declined and not used. The water used in the production goes through special treatments to ensure the microbiological safety. The water must have the correct concentration of naturally dissolved salts. The syrup is prepared in special tanks by first firstly dissolving the right amount of sugar in the treated water, and then afterwards filtering this water to remove any possible impurities. Only after this the simple syrup is mixed with the Coca Cola concentrate to make up the liquid in its final form. After this a flash pasteurisation thermal process will then ensure that even the most sensitive products will not alter in their sensory characteristic during their shelf life. The bottle production goes through the same basic pre steps as the liquid, however in this process it is paramount that the company follows legislation regarding usage of plastic and cleanliness of the product as it would otherwise be illegal to use. The filling and packaging process starts with the treated and cooled water being mixed with the final syrup and then the carbon dioxide is added. The drink is the filled into the bottles and ready to be packaged. The bottles must be perfectly clean, hermetically sealed, labeled, coded and tested. This is done by machines in a modern automatic plant. The glass bottles are then placed in boxes while the plastic bottles and canned products go into various multipacks. The Product is then shipped to the warehouse where it was intended to go from the start.","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,41,42,43],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Follows the ISO 9001"},{"id":1,"label":"Follows the ISO

The employee selects a seller and can only pay and decide upon a renting period if the seller confirms the shelf that has become available. If the seller does not confirm the shelf, the employee will pick another potential seller. After the confirmation the seller must decide their renting period which should be at least 14 weeks. Afterwards the seller needs to decide whether they pay over the phone or at the shop which requires an employee to take payment or to pay through the website which automatically will take the payment. Hereafter it is possible for the seller to maintain their shelf parallel to other activities where they can provide new items, clean the shelf, take items down and renew prices. After they have made the payment they can move out at any time without any other needed activities. Two weeks before the renting period is done, management needs to contact the seller to announce that the renting period is almost complete and ask the seller if they want an extension. However, it is also possible for sellers to contact management which then would not require management to contact them. If they do not want to extend, they will move out. If they would like an extension, management needs to check their revenue. If the revenue is equal or above 700 DKK a week then they can extend the renting period which requires the seller to choose a renting period again and new payment method. If the revenue is below 700 DKK a week then management can end the contract. Management has the choice to contact the seller again to persuade them to not extend the shelf since it is unprofitable for the shop.

{"id":"7","flavor":2,"framework":"ucca","version":1.1,"time":"11:9:53","source":"Process 20.xml","input":"There are three actors, or roles, involved in the Statement of Work (SoW) creation process consisting of two departments, the Service Sales department and the Professional Services department, and the Customer. The SoW creation process is initiated by a workshop in which the Statement of Work is developed by the Service Sales department. The SoW creation workshop contains three events: estimate project length, estimate resource hours and estimate project cost. All the activities in the SoW creation workshop are nested as the Statement of Work can only be finished if all activities are executed, hence project length, hours and cost should be estimated in order for the SoW to be completed. The SoW is then evaluated before sending it to the customer. It can either be rejected or accepted internally by the Service Sales department. If the SoW is being rejected it is not required that all estimations have to be redone. The flexibility needs to be given in order for the Service Sales department to adjust only one or two estimations or even small formalities that do not require a new SoW creation workshop. Once the adjustment is done, the SoW can be sent for internal evaluation again. This process can be repeated as many times as needed until the SoW is accepted and finally sent to the customer. Once the SoW is sent to the customer, it cannot be modified and sent to the customer again. This ensures alignment between the two parties, Tradeshift and the Customer. The Customer is then responsible for reviewing the SoW and choosing one of the three following options: Rework SoW, Reject SoW and Accept SoW. Since these activities belong to a second subprocess (Customer choice), not all activities have to be executed before moving on to an activity outside of the subprocess. If the customer accepts the SoW, it is automatically handed over to the Professional Services department. Since the accept SoW activity excludes itself, as well as decline project and reject SoW, the only possibility is to close the deal with the Service Sales department and to hand the SoW over to Professional Services, or, in case a problem arises after accepting the SoW, the model provides the needed flexibility to rework the SoW in case ad hoc changes come up. If the Customer rejects the SoW, both accept - and rework SoW are excluded activities and the project declined activity gets into a pending state, meaning it must be executed. This ends the process and Tradeshifts collaboration with the Customer until Tradeshift is potentially chosen as a vendor of choice again. If a Customer decides that rework needs to be done on the suggested SoW, the green include relation from rework SoW to the SoW creation workshop-nest indicates that any number of activities nested in the SoW creation workshop can be executed again to modify the SoW according to the Customers preference. Every time an estimation is modified, the SoW needs to be internally accepted or rejected again. This is shown by the combination of the include, condition and response relation pointing from the SoW creation workshop-nest to the SoW evaluation subprocess. Once the SoW is modified, accepted and sent to the Customer, the Customer needs to choose between the three activities in the Customer choice subprocess again. The SoW can be reworked as many times as needed, but it can only be rejected and accepted once. This is a requirement the model needs to comply with, since the rejection of a SoW indicates the end of a collaboration between Tradeshift and its customer and the acceptance of the SoW leads to the closure of the deal and a handover to Professional Services. The SoW should not be modified anymore once it is used as a project baseline in another department.","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Customer choice"},{"id":1,"label":"reject SoW"},{"id":2,"label":"accept SoW"},{"id":3,"label":"rework SoW"},{"id":4,"label":"send SoW to customer"},{"id":5,"label":"decline project"},{"id":6,"label":"handover from Service Sales"},{"id":7,"label":"SoW creation workshop"},{"id":8,"label":"estimate project length"},{"id":9,"label":"estimate resource hours"},{"id":10,"label":"estimate project cost"},{"id":11,"label":"close deal"},{"id":12,"label":"SoW evaluation"},{"id":13,"label":"internal SoW acceptance"},{"id":14,"label":"internal SoW rejection"},{"id":15,"label":"Customer"},{"id":16,"label":"Professional Services department"},{"id":17,"label":"Service Sales department"}],"edges":[{"source":1,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":2,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":3,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":5,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":6,"target":16,"label":"role"},{"source":7,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":9,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":10,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":11,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":13,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":14,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":0,"label":"condition"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"condition"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"condition"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"condition"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"condition"},{"source":4,"target":0,"label":"response"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"response"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"response"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"response"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":5,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":2,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":2,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":13,"target":7,"label":"exclude"},{"source":4,"target":4,"label":"exclude"},{"source":12,"target":12,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":11,"target":5,"label":"exclude"},{"source":3,"target":7,"label":"include"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"include"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"include"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"include"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"include"}]}

Now if the item has a low value, it is ready for delivery, but if it has a high value the Check item value activity, makes Registration available for execution. After this has been done, the delivery of the item is now a mandatory part of the process. This will end with the purchaser always closing the order in ServiceNow.

The webshop registers that a customer has sent the above request, and the webshop will then have to check stock availability.

Unfortunately, it can happen that the chosen items are not available, if that happens the webshop will display the maximum amount available of the chosen product to the customer. The customer now has to choose the product again (and add an amount within the limit) or choose another product. If the customer has successfully added items to the basket, he or she have to decide to either keep shopping, thereby following the above process again or create order. When the order has been created the customer will fill out the billing information.

{"id":"16","flavor":2,"framework":"ucca","version":1.1,"time":"11:9:53","source":"Process 2.xml","input":"Consider the following business process at an insurance company. The process includes two major roles, agents (supporting customers outdoor) and clerks (work indoors). When the insurance company receives a new claim , the clerk calls the agent to actually check the claim, and creates a new case. As both tasks are executed by different roles (that are mapped to different people), the activities are scheduled in parallel. After the agent has confirmed the claim to the clerk, he supports the customer with additional assistance (e.g. getting a new id-card from the public authority). After the clerk has received the confirmation from the agent, she issues a money order for the claim. If the agent has completed his additional support and the clerk has issued the money order, the claim is closed. Additional changes to the text (not present in the original specification): The agent will confirm the claim only after having checked it.","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"receive a new claim"},{"id":1,"label":"calls the agent to check the claim"},{"id":2,"label":"creates a new case"},{"id":3,"label":"check the claim"},{"id":4,"label":"confirm the claim"},{"id":5,"label":"supports the customer with additional assistance"},{"id":6,"label":"Blocks lost id-card"},{"id":7,"label":"Generates new id-card"},{"id":8,"label":"receive confirmation from agent"},{"id":9,"label":"issues a money order for the claim"},{"id":10,"label":"close claim"},{"id":11,"label":"agent"},{"id":12,"label":"clerk"},{"id":13,"label":"insurance company"}],"edges":[{"source":0,"target":13,"label":"role"},{"source":1,"target":12,"label":"role"},{"source":2,"target":12,"label":"role"},{"source":3,"target":11,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":11,"label":"role"},{"source":5,"target":11,"label":"role"},{"source":6,"target":11,"label":"role"},{"source":7,"target":11,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":12,"label":"role"},{"source":9,"target":12,"label":"role"},{"source":10,"target":13,"label":"role"},{"source":0,"target":1,"label":"condition"},{"source":0,"target":2,"label":"condition"},{"source":4,"target":5,"label":"condition"},{"source":8,"target":9,"label":"condition"},{"source":5,"target":10,"label":"condition"},{"source":9,"target":10,"label":"condition"},{"source":2,"target":8,"label":"condition"},{"source":3,"target":4,"label":"condition"},{"source":1,"target":3,"label":"condition"},{"source":4,"target":8,"label":"condition"},{"source":6,"target":7,"label":"condition"},{"source":4,"target":8,"label":"response"},{"source":6,"target":7,"label":"response"},{"source":0,"target":10,"label":"response"},{"source":2,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":7,"target":7,"label":"exclude"},{"source":9,"target":9,"label":"exclude"}]}
