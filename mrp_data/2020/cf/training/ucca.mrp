To make the workflow reliable two different roles are assigned. The first one is a referee from the newly created quality assurance department while the second one represents the managing director of the hospital. Both roles execute all of their tasks independently from each other. The referee starts a new case regarding a certain doctor by interviewing patients. Since a patient interview workflow is already established, it is simply integrated in the new workflow. Meanwhile, the director asks an external expert to review the work of the doctor under rating. Unfortunately, since the expert only gets a low expenses fee, it can happen that the expert is not responding in time. If that happens, another expert has to be asked (who could also not respond in time, i.e. the procedure repeats). If an expert finally sends an expertise, it is received by the director and forwarded to the referee. The referee files the results containing the patient interviews as well as the expertise and afterward creates a report. While the referee is doing this, the manager fills a check to pay the expenses of the expert.","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"interview patients","anchors":[{"from":410,"to":431}]},{"id":1,"label":" files results of interviews","anchors":[{"from":978,"to":1055}]},{"id":2,"label":"creates review report","anchors":[{"from":1070,"to":1086},{"from":1106,"to":1119}]},{"id":3,"label":"fills a check to pay the expenses of the expert","anchors":[{"from":1133,"to":1180}]},{"id":4,"label":"contact additional expert for backup review","anchors":[{"from":768,"to":782}]},{"id":5,"label":"asks external expert to review the doctor","anchors":[{"from":561,"to":594}]},{"id":6,"label":"detects that expert does not respond in time","anchors":[{"from":754,"to":766}]},{"id":7,"label":"Review doctor"},{"id":8,"label":" receives review","anchors":[{"from":911,"to":920}]},{"id":9,"label":"sends an expertise","anchors":[{"from":886,"to":904}]},{"id":10,"label":"review the work of the doctor under rating","anchors":[{"from":588,"to":594},{"from":594,"to":630}]},{"id":11,"label":" forwards external review to referee","anchors":[{"from":940,"to":965}]},{"id":12,"label":"another expert","anchors":[{"from":768,"to":782}]},{"id":13,"label":"ENGINE"},{"id":14,"label":"external expert","anchors":[{"from":568,"to":584},{"from":653,"to":663},{"from":868,"to":877}]},{"id":15,"label":"managing director","anchors":[{"from":246,"to":263},{"from":548,"to":560},{"from":1121,"to":1132},{"from":924,"to":936}]},{"id":16,"label":"referee","anchors":[{"from":150,"to":157},{"from":350,"to":361},{"from":1094,"to":1106},{"from":967,"to":978}]}],"edges":[{"source":0,"target":16,"label":"role"},{"source":1,"target":16,"label":"role"},{"source":2,"target":16,"label":"role"},{"source":3,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":5,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":6,"target":13,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":9,"target":14,"label":"role"},{"source":10,"target":14,"label":"role"},{"source":11,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":0,"target":1,"label":"condition"},{"source":1,"target":2,"label":"condition"},{"source":9,"target":8,"label":"condition"},{"source":5,"target":6,"label":"condition"},{"source":8,"target":11,"label":"condition"},{"source":10,"target":9,"label":"condition"},{"source":11,"target":1,"label":"condition"},{"source":1,"target":3,"label":"condition"},{"source":10,"target":9,"label":"response"},{"source":4,"target":5,"label":"response"},{"source":5,"target":6,"label":"response"},{"source":6,"target":4,"label":"response"},{"source":5,"target":10,"label":"response"},{"source":9,"target":8,"label":"response"},{"source":8,"target":11,"label":"response"},{"source":8,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":6,"target":7,"label":"exclude"},{"source":6,"target":4,"label":"include"},{"source":5,"target":7,"label":"include"}]}

It is marked as an event because the negotiations are not considered an action in the scope, but the decision of choosing Tradeshift as the vendor of choice lies with the customer. Therefore, an XOR-gate with two outcomes: 1) Negotiations terminated, which leads to the event of terminating the process, 2) Tradeshift is Vendor of Choice, which leads to the action of handing the customer to Service Sales. Service Sales conducts the SoW workshop with the customer, in order to scope and align expectations for the project and notifies Professional Services of an incoming project. The next step in the process is for Service Sales to create estimations for the SoW, which is, for the scope of this report, three estimations occurring simultaneously. In the model, it is demonstrated with an AND-split which is used to model the split of the three actions happening in parallel. These parallel actions are then merged with the AND-join which is used '... to synchronize the execution of two or more parallel branches.' (Dumas et al., 2013; p.82). The SoW is sent to the customer for review, and the customer then decides, depicted by the XOR-gate, whether they want to reject the SoW which terminates the project, rework it by sending it back to Service Sales for reiterations, or sign the contract in order for the project to proceed. If the customer requests to rework the SoW, it is sent back to Service Sales, and the process loops back to before the AND-split gate. This means the grouped parallel actions of SoW Creation, and the SoW review is considered a repetition block. 'We have a workshop with a customer for 1-2 days then we prepare a draft for a SoW.
