This then;starts the production.;The production has three phases, the preproduction, the production itself and the control of;the product. The pre production mainly concerns following the required legislation in order to;be allowed to produce the beverage as well as making sure all the machinery is fully;functioning and that all the ingredients are available. This is mainly done by the HQ.The second step is the actual;production of the Syrup/Liquid, Bottles,the bottling of the liquid and finally the packaging.;The last step is the shipping process in which the warehouse will receive the shipment they;need (this part also have ties to the beginning of the process as the warehouse sends an;inquiry for more product).;In the first phase the company must make sure that their standards follow the ISO 9001 and;the ISO 22000, the company's own Quality and Food Safety policy and lastly the global standards of the Coca Cola company. This involves electronic bottle inspection equipment;on all refillable bottling production lines to identify and reject even the tiniest irregularity in;their beverages. Furthermore, the process must not violate any legislation when it comes to;production of food or beverages;In the 2nd phase the production process starts with the production team making sure all ingredients are available,;then the machinery must maintained to reduce the risk of contamination or breakdowns.;The ingredients must also inspected before production to make sure that there are no;irregularities, if an irregularity presents itself, this batch of ingredients is declined and not;used. The water used in the production goes through special treatments to ensure the;microbiological safety. The water must have the correct concentration of naturally dissolved;salts. The syrup is prepared in special tanks by first firstly dissolving the right amount of;sugar in the treated water, and then afterwards filtering this water to remove any possible;impurities. Only after this the simple syrup is mixed with the Coca Cola concentrate to make;up the liquid in its final form. After this a flash pasteurisation thermal process will then ensure;that even the most sensitive products will not alter in their sensory characteristic during their;shelf life.;The bottle production goes through the same basic pre steps as the liquid, however in this;process it is paramount that the company follows legislation regarding usage of plastic and;cleanliness of the product as it would otherwise be illegal to use.;The filling and packaging process starts with the treated and cooled water being mixed with;the final syrup and then the carbon dioxide is added. The drink is the filled into the bottles;and ready to be packaged. The bottles must be perfectly clean, hermetically sealed, labeled,;coded and tested. This is done by machines in a modern automatic plant. The glass bottles;are then placed in boxes while the plastic bottles and canned products go into various;multipacks. The Product is then shipped to the warehouse where it was intended to go from;the start.","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,41,42,43],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Follows the ISO

The employee selects a seller and can only pay and decide upon a renting period if the seller confirms the shelf that has become available. If the seller does not confirm the shelf, the employee will pick another potential seller. After the confirmation the seller must decide their renting period which should be at least 14 weeks. Afterwards the seller needs to decide whether they pay over the phone or at the shop which requires an employee to take payment or to pay through the website which automatically will take the payment. Hereafter it is possible for the seller to maintain their shelf parallel to other activities where they can provide new items, clean the shelf, take items down and renew prices. After they have made the payment they can move out at any time without any other needed activities.;;Two weeks before the renting period is done, management needs to contact the seller to announce that the renting period is almost complete and ask the seller if they want an extension. However, it is also possible for sellers to contact management which then would not require management to contact them. If they do not want to extend, they will move out. If they would like an extension, management needs to check their revenue.;;If the revenue is equal or above 700 DKK a week then they can extend the renting period which requires the seller to choose a renting period again and new payment method. If the revenue is below 700 DKK a week then management can end the contract. Management has the choice to contact the seller again to persuade them to not extend the shelf since it is unprofitable for the shop. If the seller agrees to not extend, they need to move out after their renting period. However, if they disagree with management the ‘extension is granted’ and they have decided the renting period and choose a new payment method.

The roles involved in the process are the Global Relationship Manager (GRM), a Customer Service Consultant (CSC), an accountant, the DataBase Administrator (DBA) and the Head of Development (HoD):;;The GRM receives a request to become retailer. Afterwards the GRM must request more information from the potential retailer. The retailer can only provide the requested information after the request has been made. Once the information has been provided, the information must be forwarded to the CSC by the GRM. Only after the information has been forwarded the CSC register the information in Oracle. The information can only be registered in Oracle once during the process. Afterwards the CSC must create a Jira task for the HoD. Then the HoD knows that he must create a contract. The creation of the contract should only happen once to prevent misunderstandings within the process. Only once the contract has been created the HoD can send the contract. After sending the contract two scenarios are possible: a) the contract is reviewed by retailer, b) the request is automatically cancelled after 30 days of no response from retailer. If the request is cancelled automatically the rest of the process will be cancelled as well. If the contract is reviewed by retailer two additional options are possible: retailer signs contract or retailer rejects contract. If the retailer rejects the contract, the request will either be cancelled or the HoD will refine the contract due to errors in the contract. Rejection of the contract will disable the rest of the process from happening. If the request is cancelled by the retailer the process will be cancelled. If the contract is refined it eliminates the option to cancel the request before the contract has been sent once again. If the retailer chooses to sign the contract during contract review, it shouldn’t be possible to obtain more information, send the contract or cancel the request. After the retailer has signed the contract the GRM must receive the signed contract. After that the Finance department must create an invoice. The invoice can only be created once but can be sent multiple times after it has been created. After the invoice has been sent the retailer must pay the invoice once before the finance department will receive the payment one time. After the payment has been received the finance department must notify the GRM and the CSC. Once the GRM and CSC have been notified the following activities will happen: the GRM must upload the contract to COMA, the CSC must create a task in Jira for the HoD, register the retailer in webCRM once, and activate the retailer in Oracle once. These activities doesn’t have to happen in any specific order, they must however all be executed before the welcome email can be sent by the GRM. The DBA must addition also register the retailer in the Retailer Portal and whitelist the IP address before the welcome email should be allowed to be sent. The tasks the DBA has to perform can only be done once per new retailer. Before the DBA can do these tasks the CSC must have created the task in Jira.

The SoW creation workshop contains three events: “estimate project length”, “estimate resource hours” and “estimate project cost”. All the activities in the SoW creation workshop are nested as the Statement of Work can only be finished if all activities are executed, hence project length, hours and cost should be estimated in order for the SoW to be completed. The SoW is then evaluated before sending it to the customer. It can either be rejected or accepted internally by the Service Sales department. If the SoW is being rejected it is not required that all estimations have to be redone. The flexibility needs to be given in order for the Service Sales department to adjust only one or two estimations or even small formalities that do not require a new SoW creation workshop. Once the adjustment is done, the SoW can be sent for internal evaluation again. This process can be repeated as many times as needed until the SoW is accepted and finally sent to the customer. Once the SoW is sent to the customer, it cannot be modified and sent to the customer again. This ensures alignment between the two parties, Tradeshift and the Customer. The Customer is then responsible for reviewing the SoW and choosing one of the three following options: “Rework SoW”, “Reject SoW” and “Accept SoW”. Since these activities belong to a second subprocess (“Customer choice”), not all activities have to be executed before moving on to an activity outside of the subprocess.;;If the customer accepts the SoW, it is automatically handed over to the Professional Services department. Since the “accept SoW” activity excludes itself, as well as “decline project” and “reject SoW”, the only possibility is to close the deal with the Service Sales department and to hand the SoW over to Professional Services, or, in case a problem arises after accepting the SoW, the model provides the needed flexibility to rework the SoW in case ad hoc changes come up.;If the Customer rejects the SoW, both accept - and rework SoW are excluded activities and the “project declined” activity gets into a pending state, meaning it must be executed. This ends the process and Tradeshift’s collaboration with the Customer until Tradeshift is potentially chosen as a vendor of choice again.;;If a Customer decides that rework needs to be done on the suggested SoW, the green include relation from “rework SoW” to the “SoW creation workshop”-nest indicates that any number of activities nested in the “SoW creation workshop” can be executed again to modify the SoW according to the Customer’s preference. Every time an estimation is modified, the SoW needs to be internally accepted or rejected again. This is shown by the combination of the include, condition and response relation pointing from the “SoW creation workshop”-nest to the “SoW evaluation” subprocess. Once the SoW is modified, accepted and sent to the Customer, the Customer needs to choose between the three activities in the “Customer choice” subprocess again.;The SoW can be reworked as many times as needed, but it can only be rejected and accepted once. This is a requirement the model needs to comply with, since the rejection of a SoW indicates the end of a collaboration between Tradeshift and its customer and the acceptance of the SoW leads to the closure of the deal and a handover to Professional Services. The SoW should not be modified anymore once it is used as a project baseline in another department. ; ","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Customer choice"},{"id":1,"label":"reject SoW"},{"id":2,"label":"accept SoW"},{"id":3,"label":"rework SoW"},{"id":4,"label":"send SoW to customer"},{"id":5,"label":"decline project"},{"id":6,"label":"handover from Service Sales"},{"id":7,"label":"SoW creation workshop"},{"id":8,"label":"estimate project length"},{"id":9,"label":"estimate resource hours"},{"id":10,"label":"estimate project cost"},{"id":11,"label":"close deal"},{"id":12,"label":"SoW evaluation"},{"id":13,"label":"internal SoW acceptance"},{"id":14,"label":"internal SoW rejection"},{"id":15,"label":"Customer"},{"id":16,"label":"Professional Services department"},{"id":17,"label":"Service Sales department"}],"edges":[{"source":1,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":2,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":3,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":5,"target":15,"label":"role"},{"source":6,"target":16,"label":"role"},{"source":7,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":9,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":10,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":11,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":13,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":14,"target":17,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":0,"label":"condition"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"condition"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"condition"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"condition"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"condition"},{"source":4,"target":0,"label":"response"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"response"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"response"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"response"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":5,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":2,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":2,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":13,"target":7,"label":"exclude"},{"source":4,"target":4,"label":"exclude"},{"source":12,"target":12,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":11,"target":5,"label":"exclude"},{"source":3,"target":7,"label":"include"},{"source":7,"target":12,"label":"include"},{"source":13,"target":4,"label":"include"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"include"},{"source":11,"target":6,"label":"include"}]}

If Puori accepts the results Ellipse sends the report to the publishing company cleanlabelproject.com (Henceforth “Clean Label”) for 3rd party publication. If the results are rejected Ellipse re-tests the samples and a new report is subjected to Puori for acceptance or rejection. When the results are available online Clean Label notifies Puori who checks the published results, to ensure that the data is correctly displayed. Once Puori has checked the published data and no errors has been found the process is completed and terminates. Should errors be found, Puori compiles a list of errors for Clean Label to fix. When this is eventually implemented the process ends.; ","tops":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],"nodes":[{"id":0,"label":"Request Test"},{"id":1,"label":"send product sample"},{"id":2,"label":"Test Product"},{"id":3,"label":"Test product"},{"id":4,"label":"compile results"},{"id":5,"label":"Send report to Puori"},{"id":6,"label":"Additional tests"},{"id":7,"label":"Discard batch"},{"id":8,"label":"Publish results"},{"id":9,"label":"Check publication"},{"id":10,"label":"Correct errors"},{"id":11,"label":"Evaluate report"},{"id":12,"label":"Request retesting"},{"id":13,"label":"Send report to Clean Label"},{"id":14,"label":"Activity14"},{"id":15,"label":"Approve publication"},{"id":16,"label":"Compile list of errors"},{"id":17,"label":"Notify Puori"},{"id":18,"label":"Clean Label"},{"id":19,"label":"Ellipse"},{"id":20,"label":"Eurofarm"},{"id":21,"label":"Puori"},{"id":22,"label":"Storage facility"}],"edges":[{"source":0,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":1,"target":22,"label":"role"},{"source":2,"target":19,"label":"role"},{"source":3,"target":19,"label":"role"},{"source":4,"target":19,"label":"role"},{"source":5,"target":19,"label":"role"},{"source":6,"target":20,"label":"role"},{"source":7,"target":22,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":18,"label":"role"},{"source":9,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":10,"target":18,"label":"role"},{"source":11,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":12,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":13,"target":19,"label":"role"},{"source":14,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":15,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":16,"target":21,"label":"role"},{"source":17,"target":19,"label":"role"},{"source":8,"target":9,"label":"condition"},{"source":16,"target":10,"label":"condition"},{"source":12,"target":7,"label":"condition"},{"source":1,"target":2,"label":"condition"},{"source":0,"target":2,"label":"condition"},{"source":13,"target":8,"label":"condition"},{"source":2,"target":11,"label":"condition"},{"source":9,"target":14,"label":"condition"},{"source":1,"target":17,"label":"condition"},{"source":17,"target":0,"label":"condition"},{"source":8,"target":9,"label":"response"},{"source":16,"target":10,"label":"response"},{"source":10,"target":8,"label":"response"},{"source":9,"target":15,"label":"response"},{"source":13,"target":8,"label":"response"},{"source":2,"target":13,"label":"response"},{"source":12,"target":2,"label":"response"},{"source":0,"target":2,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":0,"label":"response"},{"source":1,"target":17,"label":"response"},{"source":0,"target":0,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":5,"target":5,"label":"exclude"},{"source":8,"target":8,"label":"exclude"},{"source":9,"target":9,"label":"exclude"},{"source":10,"target":10,"label":"exclude"},{"source":3,"target":3,"label":"exclude"},{"source":4,"target":4,"label":"exclude"},{"source":6,"target":6,"label":"exclude"},{"source":11,"target":11,"label":"exclude"},{"source":14,"target":14,"label":"exclude"},{"source":15,"target":10,"label":"exclude"},{"source":13,"target":7,"label":"exclude"},{"source":1,"target":1,"label":"exclude"},{"source":17,"target":17,"label":"exclude"},{"source":7,"target":2,"label":"exclude"},{"source":12,"target":2,"label":"include"},{"source":12,"target":7,"label":"include"},{"source":10,"target":8,"label":"include"},{"source":9,"target":15,"label":"include"},{"source":8,"target":9,"label":"include"},{"source":5,"target":11,"label":"include"},{"source":3,"target":4,"label":"milestone"},{"source":6,"target":4,"label":"milestone"},{"source":4,"target":5,"label":"milestone"},{"source":2,"target":8,"label":"milestone"}]}
